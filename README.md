#  Google-Style Real-Time Weather Dashboard

A modern, production-ready weather dashboard inspired by Google Weather.
Built using **FastAPI** for the backend and **React** for the frontend, the
application consumes **live data from OpenWeatherMap** to deliver accurate,
real-time weather insights with a clean, responsive user interface.

##  Overview

Weather applications must be fast, reliable, and intuitive.
This project demonstrates a **real-world full-stack architecture** for
consuming third-party APIs, processing data efficiently, and presenting
actionable insights to users in a polished UI.

The dashboard provides current conditions, forecasts, and visual trends,
while handling real-world issues such as API latency, missing data, and
network failures gracefully.
